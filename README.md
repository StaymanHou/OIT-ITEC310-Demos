This is the repo that contains all the demos for the web course.

# Setup

[Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

[Install Vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/install)

# Boot and Access the Environment

Run the command `vagrant up` to boot the container. (It can take pretty long as it builds and installs a bunch of stuff)

Run the command `vagrant ssh` to access the console of the container.

After ssh into the container, run `cd /vagrant`. All demo code is located there.
